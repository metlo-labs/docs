# Metlo

Metlo is the single source of truth repository to create, store, and query all your business metrics in a standardized way. You can build metrics with data in your warehouse, and query them wherever you want with SQL, our REST API, or our Python SDK. This makes sure that everyone in your organization gets the same, high quality data for every metric you care about.
